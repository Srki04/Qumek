# Qumek
This is a program that allow you to better organize your time. 

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h4>This is not some business or team collaboration tool. Qumek is made for personal use in whatever case you want. Just simply paste your To-Dos in it, view it in calendar and not much more XD :). There is a little bit more, but it is generally made to be easy to use program that will organize your time and with it you will be able to make your life plans for next couple of days, months, years... <br> Do not worry, I wont collect, store or mine any of user data and you can be sure in it, because it is going to work and store all of your informations on your Presolan Computer instead of some server or store device milions miles away from you. </h4>

<h2>When will Qumek be published?</h2>
